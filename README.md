# GHOST-algorithms
Solutions to exercises from GHOST algorithmic section


## Adding new sollutions
Find or create a folder with name of a section the task comes from. Lets try to use English if possible. The name of the file should same as the name in brackets right behind name of exercise. Example: https://szkopul.edu.pl/problemset/problem/LWpMcXylQBa6wHzcJ6U7axzK/site/?key=statement
"kal" in brackets so name of the file is "kal.cpp", moreover the task is from Binary search section so the full path is: "Binary Search/kal.cpp". If you find some tasks on other site like "leetcode" please create or add to a file called "moreTasks.md" link to this task. Create this file in a folder with the right section eg. "Biniary Search".

## Naming commits

Name of commit should be "{name of section} | {name_of_task or multiple separated by comas} | {additional_comments}"
